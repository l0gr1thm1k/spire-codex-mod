// The upload disclosure (M3-C trust gate). One card, two modes:
//
//  - Onboarding, when nobody has answered yet (or uploads were switched on in settings without
//    a grant): the full "what gets uploaded" body with Turn on / Keep off. Turn on persists the
//    grant, which also lets RunUploader flush held runs; Keep off flips UploadRuns back off and
//    saves, so re-enabling in settings re-asks.
//
//  - Re-disclosure, when someone granted against an OLDER disclosure than the current one.
//    Consent.Answered is sticky for the life of a machine, so without this mode a change to
//    what we collect would apply silently to every existing player. Their run uploads are not
//    interrupted and their grant is not reset; the card just says what is new, and the newer
//    data stays held until they answer it. Added when replays shipped: agreeing to "completed
//    runs (character, deck, relics, score, seed, result)" in v1.0.10 is not agreement to a
//    per-decision journal of how you play.
