// Ordering is not optional. The endpoint 404s until the run doc exists, so the .run is always
// uploaded first and its response hands us the run_hash — the mod never computes that hash
// itself, which is also what keeps co-op correct (after PR #1019 the response carries the hash
// of the SUBMITTING player's slot, so a non-host's replay lands on their own run).
//
// Gated by UploadReplays, which requires UploadRuns and a consent grant given against a
// disclosure that names replays. Consent.Answered is sticky forever, so gating on Granted alone
// would have started sending per-action journals from everyone who agreed to "completed runs"
// back in v1.0.10 without them ever seeing a card that says so.
